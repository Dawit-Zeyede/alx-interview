# 0. Island Perimeter

This project is designed to calculate the perimeter of an island in a 2D grid, where the grid consists of `1`'s (land) and `0`'s (water). The task is to determine the perimeter by counting the number of edges of land cells that are exposed to water or the grid boundary. Using basic Python structures, you will iterate through the grid, check each land cell's neighboring cells, and determine whether each contributes to the island's perimeter. The solution must be implemented without using any external libraries and should follow Python's PEP 8 guidelines.

To solve the problem, youâ€™ll need to work with 2D arrays (matrices), apply conditional logic to identify land cells, and count the perimeter edges. The grid can vary in size, and the solution must handle different dimensions. The project will test your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and logical reasoning. The Python script should be executable and well-documented to meet the project requirements.
