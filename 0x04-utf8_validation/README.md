This project is focused on creating a Python program that validates whether a dataset of integers represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a widely used encoding format that represents Unicode characters through a variable number of bytes (1 to 4). Using bitwise operations, list manipulation, and logical checks, you will determine if each byte sequence conforms to UTF-8 encoding rules.

Key skills include understanding the UTF-8 encoding scheme, bitwise operations in Python, and list manipulation. By applying these concepts, you will check that each byte pattern matches a valid UTF-8 character sequence, ensuring proper data representation.
