The Prime Game is a strategic game where two players, Maria and Ben, take turns picking prime numbers from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to a given number n. Once a prime number is selected, that prime and all its multiples are removed from the set. The player who cannot make a valid move loses the game. The challenge involves determining the winner of each game given multiple rounds with different values of n. The game is played optimally by both players, with Maria always going first.
In this project, you are tasked with writing a Python function isWinner(x, nums) that simulates multiple rounds of the Prime Game. The function takes in two arguments: x, which is the number of rounds, and nums, a list of integers representing the maximum value n for each round. The function should return the name of the player who won the most rounds, or None if there is a tie. The key part of the challenge lies in determining the optimal moves in each round using prime number properties, efficient algorithms, and game theory principles.
This project involves understanding prime numbers, implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes for efficient prime number identification, and applying basic game theory strategies. The game can be represented as a sequence of optimal decisions where the goal is to force the opponent into a losing position. To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming and memoization to optimize the calculation of the winner for each round. The Python solution adheres to PEP 8 coding standards and runs efficiently within the given problem constraints.
