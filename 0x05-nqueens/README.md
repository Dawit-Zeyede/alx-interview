The N Queens project is a classic backtracking problem that involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The solution requires implementing a backtracking algorithm that explores each row and column to find safe positions for each queen, using recursion to backtrack when a valid placement cannot be found. Key skills for this project include understanding recursion, managing list manipulations for board positions, and handling command-line arguments in Python to specify the board size. This project is an excellent way to practice algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and optimization in Python.
